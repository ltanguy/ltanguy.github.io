      <title>Authorization with TLS Mutual Authentication</title>

      <description>TLS Mutual Authentication (TLS MA or more commonly nowadays mTLS) is increasingly being leveraged for securing links between applications (see the section of Istio&amp;rsquo;s documentation on security as an example).
It provides a much more robust and secure solution than static shared credentials:
 Shared credentials are susceptible to brute-force attacks. mTLS is not. Shared credentials should be periodically rotated. In practice, this is almost never the case as the process is particularly painful and implies the rotation of the credentials at the server and client level simultaneously.</description>
